# Archive Arcade

## What is this?
This is a series of games created as my final project for RISD’s Graduate Studio I during the Fall 2022 semester. The games utilize facial recognition, specifically smiling, and comment on our relationship to news headlines and our changing world.

## How can I use this repository?
You can access the site by going to [gabrieldrozdov.github.io/archive-arcade](https://gabrieldrozdov.github.io/archive-arcade/).

## Who made this?
The site was designed and developed fully by Gabriel Drozdov (me!). The course’s instructors were Bethany Johns and Ramon Tejada.
